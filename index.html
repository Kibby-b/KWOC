KWOC Project report 
#About KWOC
KWOC — Kharagpur Winter of Code is a 5-week long online program organised by KOSS for the students of various colleges, especially for students of IIT Kharagpur, who are new to open source software development.
#About me
I am a beginner in Open source and KWOC 2020 is my first open source program. I learned a lot through trial and error about the basics of Git and GitHub, how to make PR, forking repositories, pushing code and coordinating with mentors and assignments. I also made my first PR and hopefully, gained the knowledge to work on more projects.

#My tech stack
•	Front end: HTML, CSS, Javasript
•	Backend: Django, Python
•	Other: Data Science
#selecting projects
I selected 2 projects based on my Tech Stack:
1)	Snippet Share – It is code snippet sharing app that lets you share syntax highlighted code snippets with easy copy paste options and a secure secret code and a unique url. This project was based on Django. I worked on the bug revolving around invalid username being accepted. (PR #40 #44). 
I tried a few different approaches like writing scripts and using onclick, onselect events, added a message to be displayed if user enters a wrong username – which also defines how the format should be in the form of a warning. I finally used Regex string to check and match structure of username entered.


 
 
 

1)	Statistics and Econometrics for Data Science
I was assigned the notebook for panel data and explored that, I am still exploring since it is a complex topic for me and would be pursuing this further. 
I wanted to mention this project since I had never worked in the direction of using data analytics for econometrics and this motivated me to learn further in this direction and contribute soon. (Issue 9)

 


#My learning
I learned the following in terms of experiences:
1)	Validation and debugging in Django
2)	Git and GitHub
3)	Communication with project coordinators
4)	Panel data and models associated with it


#Concluding work
I worked at different approaches from using events in javascript to regex strings for validation. I explored the different ways we could apply validation in the project and improved the code by selecting the method with less lines of code i.e. using a regex string and made my first PR.  
I also explored panel data analysis but data science being fairly new to me, wasn’t able to make a successful PR but have since then learned a lot about the application of data analysis in economics and statistics, a direction I didn’t approach before.
I learned a lot by contributing to these projects or exploring them and talking about it with mentors, thus concluding my first ever run of the Winter of Code. Hopefully, I would be able to make more contributions next year since I have learnt git and github as well and a lot about version control as well. 
#My Thoughts
I had a great time with Kharagpur Winter of Code, considering that I made my first PR on this platform and my first run in with Git and GitHub platform. 
Also, earlier I did not know how to get open source projects and approach people on GitHub which has fairly changed now that I have done exactly that for the two projects I have worked on.
I would like to thank my project coordinator: Pragati Verma and Pankhuri Saxena , who shared their insights and knowledge about their respective fields on Gitter and resolved many of my own issues by resolving questions and doubts of other members on a fairly regular basis.
My PR:
(PR #40 #44).
